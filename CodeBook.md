# Basically, we did 2 step process from the raw data

## Step 1 was to extract the mean and standard deviation columns 

## But, before taking these columns out , I had to understand the data,
## Also had to verify which of the files to use, which ones to merge, union or join etc


## Step 2 was a simple group by, which I accomplished using sqldf, There might be a faster approach 
## by using other R packages. Was not able to do that, so resorted to SQL.
